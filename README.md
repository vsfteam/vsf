Full name of VSF is "Versaloon Software Framework". VSF is an open-source software framework for embedded applications based on Apache2 license. VSF includes hal, a pre-emptive multi-thread kernel, services and components. VSF is implemented by C language with object-oriented programming methods(PLOOC).

## Kernel
Pre-emptive kernel based on event-driven architecture, supporting mcs51, 8bit MCU, 32/64 bit ARM, riscv, x86, etc.

- event-driven architecture, sleep if no event occurred, lower-power naturally
- in pre-emptive mode, task switch is implemented by hardware swi(software interrupt), priority of task is the priority of the swi.
- pre-emptive scheduling for tasks with different priority, collaborative scheduling for tasks with the same priority
- can run in other RTOS as a task, or as swi ISR
- different tasks
  - event handler task -- minimum resources usage, 20 bytes ram usage for minimum configuration, 40 bytes ram usage for normal configuration
  - pt task
  - thread with dedicated stack -- depending on setjmp in libc
  - fsm task
  - other tasks in shell, eg pthread
- IPC: semaphore, mutex, trigger, queue, etc

## Components
- Reasonable framework for code re-use
- declarative development model
- standard interface, standard port for 3rd-party components
- software components
  - distbus -- distributed bus framework
  - fifo
  - heap
  - json
  - pool
  - stream
  - trace
- Components
  - fs -- filesystem with vfs support
  - input -- input sub-system
  - mal -- memory abstraction layer(normally known as 'block' device)
  - scsi -- SCSI device
  - tcpip -- TCPIP stack and netdrv drivers
  - ui -- UI and display drivers
  - usb -- USB host/slave stacks
  - bt -- bt stack(using btstack)

## HAL -- hardware abstraction layer
- standard hal interface and API -- eg: vsf_spi_init can be used with hardware SPI, GPIO emulated SPI, SPI from external usb device, etc
- IP core driver -- simplify porting by implement clock, reset, interrupt functions which is not provided by IP core
- template for different interfaces and functionalities
- interfaces
  - PM
  - GPIO
  - SPI
  - I2C
  - PWM
  - ADC
  - SWI
  - USART
  - FLASH
  - USB
  - ethernet

## Shell
To use applications from other system, shell can be used.

- SDL -- use applications based on SDL directly
- linux -- use applications based on linux directly
  - posix
  - devfs
  - socket
  - console
  - libraries
    - libusb
    - libgen
    - libsdl2
    - libcurl
    - etc
